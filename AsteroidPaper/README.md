# Materials for Predicting Asteroid Size Estimation paper
Vedrana's code and other material to reproduce analysis and figures from the Predicting Asteroid Size Estimation paper

[Code to create analysis and figures used in paper](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/analyzeSDSSWISE_IIpaper.ipynb)

Tools needed for running above code: [plotting](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/plottingTools.py) and [analysis](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/analysisTools.py)

Data files used: [high quality sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/fig15_data.csv) and [full SDSS-WISE sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/MOC_W3.csv)

Pkl files to speed up running of the code: [high quality sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/XD_toy_11percpV2percColors.pkl) and [full SDSS-WISE sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/XD_toy_fullSDSSWISE.pkl)
