# Materials for the "Predicting Asteroid Size Estimation" paper
Vedrana's code and other material to reproduce analysis and figures from the Predicting Asteroid Size Estimation paper.
Clone this repo, start analyzeSDSSWISE_IIpaper.ipynb as jupyter notebook, and if you have all the dependencies installed, you should be good to go!
To verify correct running, compare your figures to the those linked below (in subdirectory Figures).

[Code to create analysis and figures used in paper](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/analyzeSDSSWISE_IIpaper.ipynb)

Tools needed for running above code: [plotting](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/plottingTools.py) and [analysis](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/analysisTools.py)

Data files used: [high quality sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/data/fig15_data.csv) and [full SDSS-WISE sample](https://github.com/ivezicV/2share/blob/master/AsteroidPaper/data/MOC_W3.csv)
